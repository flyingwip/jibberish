# Welcome to Jibberish!

This is a small demo on how to make **jibberish** of some words.The first and last character are excluded and from the jibberish. This is based on a research "Why your brain can read jumbled letters"

# Example

"The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (commonly called Coachella or the Coachella Festival) is an annual music and arts festival held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, in the Coachella Valley in the Colorado Desert."

can come out as:

"The Celcholaa Valley Music and Atrs Feastivl (colmnomy claeld Claloehca or the Cehllcoaa Fviestal) is an ananul muisc and atrs faseitvl held at the Ermpie Polo Club in Indio, Clnaoifria, in the Cleoclhaa Vlelay in the Cordolao Dseret."

- Only words with more then three characters are jibberished
- Only characters from the alphabet are jibberished. For example: "Coachella!" => "Ceclahola!"
